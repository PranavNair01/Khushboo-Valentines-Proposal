          I don’t know when I fell in love with you.
          <br />
          But I know that I did.
        </p>

        <p>
          Exactly 11 months ago today,
          <br />
          I had no idea that one swipe
          <br />
          would end up changing my life.
        </p>

        <p>
          That the universe would quietly do its thing
          <br />
          and cross my path
          <br />
          with an amazing human.
        </p>

        <p>
          Babe, I don’t know what I did to deserve you.
        </p>

        <p>
          But I am grateful.
        </p>

        <p>
          I’m grateful to have met a girl who genuinely cares for me —
          <br />
          someone jisse darr lagta hai.
        </p>

        <p>
          I’m grateful to have met a girl so smart
          <br />
          that she knows something about almost everything —
          <br />
          someone jiske wajah se
          <br />
          I feel motivated to read, research,
          <br />
          and be a better person.
        </p>

        <p>
          I’m grateful to have met a girl who is
          <br />
          cute, pretty, sexy,
          <br />
          and at the same time, beautiful —
          <br />
          someone jiske liye
          <br />
          I started paying attention to my fashion sense
          <br />
          for the first time,
          <br />
          and actually tried to be a good boyfriend.
        </p>

        <p>
          I’m grateful to have met a girl
          <br />
          who truly loves me,
          <br />
          makes me feel like I matter,
          <br />
          and makes me feel at home —
          <br />
          someone jiske wajah se
          <br />
          lagta hai ki zindagi mein
          <br />
          khone ke liye bhi kuch hai.
        </p>

        <p>
          I’m grateful to have met <strong>you</strong>, Khushboo.
        </p>

        <p>
          I’m not very good with words.
          <br />
          So…
